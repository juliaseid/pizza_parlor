## Description

_This program is a website that allows users to create a pizza according to their preferences of size and toppings, returning a price for that order._

_Specifications:_
* By default, when a user begins to customize a pizza order, the pizza will be set to a large cheese pizza with red sauce.

* A price will not display until the user clicks "Confirm Order"

* A user must select size first.  There are 3 sizes, each with a base price.

* The user may substitute an olive oil or white sauce base.  Olive oil does not change the price; white sauce has an upcharge.

* Then a user may select toppings.  The first 3 toppings have a fixed price.  Additional toppings are broken into price categories.
